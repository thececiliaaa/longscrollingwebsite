        <p class="rocktext"> Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later. It has gone through an amazing evolution to end up where it is now.

        <p class="fiftytext"> Rock and roll dominated popular music in the 1950s and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate origins lay in a mixing together of various musical genres of the time. In 1951, disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase "rock and roll" to describe the music.
        <br>
        <br>
        Elvis Presley was the most successful artist of the popular sound of rock and roll. He brought rock and roll widely into the mainstream of popular culture, popularized the four-man group and also brought the guitar to become the lead instrument in rock music. Presley popularized rockabilly, a genre that combined country with rhythm and blues which some claimed it was a new sound.</p>

      <div class="sixtyinfo" id="sixtyinfo">
        <p class="sixtytext"> In the early-1960s, rock and roll in its purest form was gradually overtaken by pop rock, beat, psychedelic rock, blues rock, and folk rock, which had grown in popularity. British rock broke through to mainstream popularity in the United States in January 1964 with the success of the Beatles. "I Want to Hold Your Hand" was the band's first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, starting the British Invasion of the American music charts.
        <br>
        <br>
        The British Invasion helped internationalize the production of rock and roll, and played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music, and cemented the primacy of the rock group, based on guitars and drums and producing their own material as singer-songwriters.</p>

      <div class="seventyinfo" id="seventyinfo">
        <p class="seventytext"> The 1970s saw the emergence of hard rock as one of the most prominent subgenres of rock music. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with keyboards.
        <br>
        <br>
        Acts such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Nazareth, and Black Sabbath were highly popular during the first half of the decade. By the second half of the decade, many other acts had also achieved stardom, namely, AC/DC, Kiss, Aerosmith, Van Halen and Ted Nugent.</p>

      <div class="eightyinfo" id="eightyinfo">
        <p class="eightytext"> In the 1980s, rock music was more precisely defined and split up into multiple subgenres. Rock music continued to enjoy a wide audience. Soft rock, glam metal, thrash metal, shred guitar characterized by heavy distortion, pinch harmonics and whammy bar abuse became very popular.
        <br>
        <br>
        The 1980s saw the emergence of wildly popular hard rock band Guns N' Roses and the successful comebacks of Aerosmith and Alice Cooper in the late 1980s.</p>

      <div class="ninetyinfo" id="ninetyinfo">
        <p class="ninetytext"> The rise of grunge, a hybrid of punk and the hard-rock sound of 1970s and 1980s heavy metal, was popularized in the early 1990s by Seattle-based bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Grunge’s raw, jarring sound was matched with lyrics that usually seemed to express a downbeat, even nihilistic worldview that was drenched in self-deprecating irony; “I feel stupid and contagious / here we are now, entertain us,” Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain sang in “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” a hit single whose name sprang from a deodorant marketed to teenagers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Grunge devotees rebelled against the idea of rock stars as glamorous, fashionably coiffed celebrities, instead dressing in flannel shirts and ragged jeans and sporting unruly long hair.</p>

      <div class="ooinfo" id="ooinfo">
        <p class="ootext"> Rock music was still popular, notably alternative rock, and especially genres such as post-grunge, nu metal, pop punk, emo, post-hardcore, metalcore, and in some cases indie rock. During the early 2000s, a new wave of metal began with interest in the newly emerging genre nu metal and genres of a similar style such as rap metal and the later mainstream success rap rock.
        <br>
        <br>
        Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory, released in 2000, sold over 24 million copies worldwide. In 2004, nu metal lost popularity. Since then, many bands have changed to other genres of music, such as post-grunge, heavy metal, and alternative rock.</p>

      <div class="currentinfo" id="currentinfo">
        <p class="currenttext"> Rock has remained popular, although it has declined in chart presence since the late 2000s alongside changes in radio format. These changes were driven by the decline in compact discs and rise of downloads in the music industry, which prompted a focus on top 40 music. Rock has also moved from hard rock and heavy metal, which have dominated since the mid-1980s. Mainstream rock since the early 2010s has become softer and more refined because of indie rock.
        <br>
        <br>
        Indie rock has become one of the most successful subgenres of the decade. The top widespread indie musicians this decade have been Imagine Dragons, Neon Trees, X Ambassadors, Twenty One Pilots, and many others.</p>
