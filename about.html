        Hi there!
        <br>
        This website is inspired by my love for music. Every generation in my family had a passion for rock music, and I grew up listening to a lot of different rock bands. It's definitely a huge part of my childhood and so with this in mind, I put this long scrolling website together.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hope you enjoy this site as much as I enjoyed making it! :)
